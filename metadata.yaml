description: 'Albert Payson Terhune, an acclaimed journalist and collie expert, shot
  to literary fame as the author of a beloved series of tales featuring his own collie,
  Lad. In His Dog, Terhune explores the dog-human bond from a different angle: a young
  farmer finds an injured dog and nurses it back to health, only to discover that
  the resulting friendship is more than he ever bargained for -- in more ways than
  one.'
